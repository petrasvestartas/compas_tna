# Summary

[Replace with ~2–4 sentences for a non-specialist audience.]  
COMPAS TNA provides Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) for discrete funicular form finding within the COMPAS computational framework. It enables structural designers and researchers to model and explore compression-only structures using a consistent Python API and interoperable data structures.

# Statement of need

[What problem it solves, who it is for, and relation to existing work.]  
Designing compression-only structures requires numerical methods to satisfy equilibrium under given loads and geometric constraints. Existing solutions are fragmented or tied to specific environments. COMPAS TNA offers an open, Pythonic implementation integrated with the COMPAS ecosystem, enabling reproducible research and extensible workflows in structural design and education.

# State of the field

[How this compares to commonly used packages.]  
Summarize comparable tools (e.g., academic prototypes, commercial plugins) and explain differences in scope, openness, extensibility, and interoperability (e.g., integration with COMPAS, scripting, data model).

# Use cases

[Ongoing research projects, classes, or publications enabled by this software.]  
Briefly list 2–3 representative examples and links if available.
